            <h3>Stateless Webgl Shader Particles</h3>
            <p><a href="lab/particles/" target="_blank"><img src="img/gpuParticles.png" alt="Screenshot of GPU Particles Demo. "></a>
                An experiment created while developing the particle vertex and fragment shader code used in
                this website. While my site is effortlessly using around 5000 GPU particles and the demo starts with
                30000, on a decent machine a GPU can handle quantities around the hundreds of thousands.</p>

            <h3>Audioreactive 2D Canvas Particles</h3>
            <p><a href="https://espaciocasanave.github.io/openvjkit/" target="_blank"><img src="img/openvjkit-thmb.png" alt="Screenshot of openvjkit. "></a>
                The current result of various live coding sessions during live music performances using 2D
                Canvas and the Web Audio APIs. You need to grant the page access to your microphone and
                permission to open a second window for displaying the graphical output as it is intended
                to run on two monitors. While not easily accesible, it also has hard coded MIDI controller
                functionality that you can adapt if you download the <a href="https://github.com/espaciocasanave/openvjkit/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">gh-pages branch from the github repo.</a></p>

            <h3>2D Canvas Game Experiment</h3>
            <p><a href="lab/weboids/" target="_blank"><img src="img/weboids-thmb.png" alt="Screenshot of game demo. "></a>
                A small experiment written while teaching about game coding. It's using Box2DWeb for physics and the HTML Canvas 2D API.</p>

            <h3>vminpoly</h3>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/saabi/vminpoly" target="_blank"><img src="img/vminpoly.png" alt="Screenshot of vminpoly demo. "></a>
                A polyfill for the newer CSS3 distance units and some media queries.</p>

            <h3>P.D.:</h3>
            <p>While there are more experiments that I've built over time that I want to publish, I'm still
                working on this website so hang on and they'll start showing up as my time allows! In the

            <h3>Collections: Multivalue-per-key Maps</h3>
            <p>The Java Collections API in java.util.* is a very powerful and fundamental toolkit for 
                managing sets of objects and is used in practically all facets of software development, 
                from low-level caches, to O/R mapping, to GUIs.</p>
            <p>However, occasionally we have needs that extend beyond the basic functionality provided 
                in the API. One very common need not handled by the collections framework is to provide 
                maps that can hold many values for a particular key, much like databases feature non-unique 
                key indexes. Having such a collection class would make this job very simple in Java.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t17048.html">Continue reading...</a></p>

            <h3>Algorithms: Phonetic Coder for Spanish Words</h3>
            <p>Sometime ago I posted some code which ranks names according to their similarities based on 
                Levenshtein's word difference algorithm. In this article I mentioned I had developed an 
                algorithm to encode names quasi-phonetically according to their pronounciation in Spanish, 
                much in the spirit of Soundex and Metaphone.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've received a few requests by email with respect to this algorithm so I think 
                it would be good to answer them all in a single Java Tip, while simultaneusly showing how 
                to use Regular Expressions efficiently in Java.</p>

            <h3>Technique: Generic Linked Lists through Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Although the java.util.LinkedList class included in the JDK is good enough for most cases 
                requiring linked lists, sometimes conditions will arise when it might not be as useful.</p>
            <p>Here I propose an alternative implementation using a combination of generics and inheritance 
                optimized for better memory economy and possibly a slight increase in speed, although the 
                latter should be barely noticeable. This example will also illustrate some interesting 
                applications of generics.</p>
            <p>To understand where I'm coming from I'll need to explain some things about how Java stores 
                objects in the heap and how this affects the standard LinkedList implementation.</p>

            <h3>Persistence Layers</h3>
            <p>As I undertake my first project management role, where Ill be leading a really small group of 
                3 developers (myself included) into an agile development effort, Im allowing myself to look at 
                all the unconventional technologies on the look out for interesting innovations before the 
                design is completely fixed. I will however keep a conservative attitude so as not to get too 
                excited about the toys to be found out in the wild (wild toys might eat your project and 
                your budget!).</p>

            <h3>Text: Human Names Similarity using Levenshtein Algorithm</h3>
            <p>Using the previously posted Levenshtein Edit Distance method, this one builds upon the 
                functionality to provide a name similarity ranking.</p>
            <p>The benefits it provides over using plain LD is that it is indifferent to the order a person's 
                name is written, thus being very useful for sorting results of name searches.</p>

            <h3>Text: Levenshtein Word Distance</h3>
            <p>Here's a small implementation of the Levenshtein Word Distance algorythm written in Java.</p>
            <p>The algorythm is good for measuring edit distance between two words and is normally used for 
                spell checking and similarity sorting, but I've been told it can be used for other things as 
                well. If you want some in depth explanation of how it works check out this site or this one 
                that has a nice little applet showing its internals at work.</p>

            <h3>Swing: Tiling Windows</h3>
            <p>JDesktopPane as it is doesn't provide tiling and cascading. Here's the routine for tiling. Its 
                priority is to get as many windows as possible to have the same size. Here's the code 
                cascading windows.</p>

            <h3>Swing: Cascading Windows</h3>
            <p>JDesktopPane as it is doesn't provide tiling and cascading. Here's a simple routine for cascading.</p>
            <p>The code is implemented in static methods for simplicity but some might prefer to include the 
                methods in a subclass of JDesktopPane or a DesktopManager.</p>

            <h3>Graphics: Painting Textures Fast</h3>
            <p>Following the recent Java2D discussion some of you might be wondering how to put some of that 
                information to good use. A deeper understanding of why TexturePaint results in lower preformance 
                can be found in that thread.</p>
            <p>Here's a simple way to paint an arbitrary Java2D Shape with a texture using all the hardware 
                acceleration the current rendering pipelines can provide. This routine, although still having 
                lots of room for important optimizations, is a lot faster than ye' old TexturePaint.</p>

            <h3>Face to face with Java2D</h3>
            <p>Woa! Don't fire up those flame-throwers just yet! This isn't a thread about why native code is 
                better, etc, etc. I mean to say that Java2D could fly just using better Java code.</p>
            <p>Take Color, GradientPaint and TexturePaint and the low-level pipelines that actually paint stuff 
                with these classes for example. Here are three implementations of the Paint interface that really 
                make me wonder what's going on over at Sun.</p>
